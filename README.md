# Self-Supervised-Approach-for-facial-movement-based-optical-flow
This repository will contain source code and models used in our paper titled "Self-Supervised Approach for Facial Movement Based Optical Flow", available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01256.

# Data generation
The source code and functions used to generate the data based on the paper are found in "dataset_gen.py".

# Models and evaluation
We will add settings and instructions here to either train or evaluate optical flow
